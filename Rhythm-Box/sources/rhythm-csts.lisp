; Constraints are defined as instance of the class <constraint>, which is a container
; for a function that post the gecode constraints and its parameters.
; 
; To create a constraint, one must create an OM method (i.e. via defmethod!) that returns
; the constraint instance. 
; For readability reasons, the following constraints always return a function called "post-<cst>"
; that calls the <cst> by rearranging the args.


; Constraint REL-PULSE
; The specified positions must contain a note of duration with the specified relation 
; to the specified value (e.g. equal to 1/4 or greater than 1/16).
