# Rhythm-Box

Rhythm-Box is a constraint-based musical composition assistant destined to be used in OpenMusic. It uses constraint programming to generate rhythms from an input rhythm sequence.

## How to use

Once Gecode and OpenMusic are installed, simply add the Rhythm-Box folder to your OpenMusic library folder. You have to also include the GiL library (https://github.com/blapiere/GiL). A tutorial of how to use the tool inside OpenMusic is given in the **Rhythm-Box introduction** pdf from my master's thesis.
